I successfully cloned the class repository from `https://github.com/olearydj/INSY6500` to
`~/insy6500/class_repo`.

### Key Commands Used
- `git clone <url>` - Create local copy of remote repository
- `git log` - View commit history
- `git remote -v` - Check remote repository connections
## Part 2: Portfolio Repository Creation
I created my personal course repository with:
- Professional README.md describing the project
- Proper .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files
- Organized directory structure for homework, projects, and notes
### Understanding Git Workflow
The three-stage workflow:
1. Working Directory: Where I edit files
2. Staging Area: Where I prepare commits with `git add`
3. Repository: Where commits are permanently stored with `git commit`
## Part 3: GitHub Publishing
Successfully published repository to GitHub:
- Used `git remote add origin` to connect local repo to GitHub
- Used `git push -u origin main` to upload commits
- Verified all files and commits are visible on GitHub
### The Remote Connection
My local repository is now connected to GitHub:
- `git remote -v` shows the remote URL
- `git push` will send my commits to GitHub
- `git pull` will get updates from GitHub (if changes are made on GitHub)
