    "1. What are the statistics of each main category?\n",
    "1. What portion of sales does each Category represent?\n",
    "1. What is the percentage of each category that is made up of its sub categories?\n",
    "### Product & Category Behavior\n",
    "1. Which product categories are sold together? Which product sub categories are sold together?\n",
    "1. Are there Categories, Sub-Categories, or Products that trend amongs certain segments?\n",
    "1. Does the popularity of products change over time?\n",
    "### Customer Behavior\n",
    "1. How does customer segment impact ordering habits? (Sales, number of order, order frequency)\n",
    "1. How many orders are from repeat customers -> do some additional statistics on this how many orders do the customers make, how often do they make them, are the values of the orders consistent? Bin customers by number of orders and see if they spend different amounts per transaction?\n",
    "1. What is the revenue breakdown? (One time customer vs repeat, Segment)\n",
    "1. How does sales break down per customer? (Build a distribution that shows % of customers vs % of sales, 5% customers give 50% sales etc.)\n",
    "1. What is the average time it takes for a customer to reorder?\n",
    "1. Is total spend indicative of more orders or just higher value orders?\n",
    "1. How does Ship Mode relate to order price and customer segment?\n",
    "1. How do monthly or seasonal sales trends vary across Regions, Categories, and Segments?\n",
    "### Geography\n",
    "1. What are the outlying states for purchase amount and frequency?\n",
    "1. What are the outlying cities for purchase amount and frequency?\n",
